In the table above, the variables are the % shift to Trump and county median income. The unit of observation is one county in the United States.\n\nStep 1: Statistical Significance\n\nIdentify coefficients with a star. In the table above, \\(-0.158\\) is a coefficient. For the OLS regression with one variable presented above, \\(-0.158\\) represents the slope in the single variable linear equation. In other types of regressions, a coefficient is similar to a slope, but not identical to one.\nThe star is a very approximate indicator of coefficients that are worth paying attention to. These are called statistically significant coefficients.\n\nStep 2: Direction of the Effect\n\nLook at the direction of the coefficient/slope. Is it positive or negative?\nWe can only be confident in the direction of the effect if the coefficient is statistically significant.\n\nStep 3: Substantive Significance/Effect Size\n\nSubstantive significance indicates whether we care about the size of the effect/coefficient. It is not the same as statistical significance, and is at least as important as statistical significance.\nThe coefficient \\(-0.158\\) indicates our best guess about the effect size. This can be translated into an indication of substantive significance, but is never more than a best guess.\nThe next sections describe how to interpret coefficients in linear regressions. For other regressions, rely on the author to interpret the substantive meaning of the reported coefficients.",

    "text": "As in a simple linear regression, we can use the numeric values of the coefficients to make imperfect guesses about the magnitudes of their effects. As with interpreting the direction of the effect in a multiple linear regression, we must account for the fact that each coefficient on an \\(x\\) variable is a marginal effect. That is, each coefficient \\(\\beta_i\\) represents the change in \\(y\\) when \\(x_i\\) changes and all other \\(x\\) variables are held constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% shift to Trump, 2012-2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty median income ($1,000s)\n\n\n-0.158*\n\n\n-0.013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.006)\n\n\n(0.007)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty college experience\n\n\n\n\n-0.344*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n8.337*\n\n\n20.103*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.351)\n\n\n(0.512)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n3,111\n\n\n3,111\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.203\n\n\n0.371\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n* p&lt;0.05\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty median income\n\nOur best guess is that a $1,000 increase in county median income is associated with a -0.013% shift to Trump between 2012 and 2016 when education levels are held constant.\nWe are not confident that this effect is truly negative, because the coefficient is not statistically significant now that county education levels have been controlled for.\nChanges in statistical significance and effect size can happen when adding controls to a regression, particularly when there is a strong correlation between the \\(x\\) variables.\nBecause we are not confident in the direction of the effect of county median income, we do not attempt to interpret the effect size of county income.\n\n\n\nCounty college experience\n\n\n\nOur best guess is that a 1% increase in county educational levels is associated with a -0.344% shift to Trump between 2012 and 2016 when income levels are held constant. As noted on the prior page, this is a statistically significant effect, so we are confident it is a negative effect, not null or positive.\nThe range of the values for county education is from roughly 20% to 90%. That’s 70 units. So a county at the bottom end of the spectrum has shifts to Trump by around \\(-0.344*70\\% = 24\\)% more than a county at the highest education levels. If the best guess is in the right ballpark, this is a substantively significant change.\nYou can examine this change in the graphic above. The points described in the calculations have been marked with red diamonds. You can spin the graphic and hover over the red diamonds to see that a change of 70% in college experience is associated with a 24% change in the shift to Trump between 2012 and 2016.\nIn this case, the estimated effect of education in this model is both statistically and substantively significant.",
