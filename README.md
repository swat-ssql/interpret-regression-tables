Interpreting and Visualizing Regression Tables

This document provides a basic understanding of regression tables commonly presented in quantitative papers and highlights common heuristics for interpreting those tables. It is directed towards those with

-   no background in statistics,

-   an introductory background in statistics, or

-   an interest in 3 dimensional visualizations of regression surfaces and marginal effects (see [the section on multiple linear regression](http://localhost:5676/07_multiplereg_equation.html) ).

It is intended to augment, not replace, statistics classes. The reader should have particular caution around the meaning of statistical significance, a complex concept that generally requires multiple statistics courses to adequately understand.
