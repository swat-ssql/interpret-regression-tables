<p>The interpretation of the direction of each coefficient is a bit different than in a simple linear regression. In a simple linear regression, which has one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> variable, the coefficient is interpreted the same as a slope in a linear equation. In a multiple regression, the coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> reported for each variable <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> represents the <strong>marginal effect</strong> of that variable on the outcome, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The marginal effect shows how much the outcome, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, changes as <em>one</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> variable changes and <em>all other</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> variables are held constant (i.e.&nbsp;they do not change). These effects are depicted in the image below.</p>

<p>The regression surface, <span class="math inline">\(y \sim x_1 + x_2\)</span>, is shown in blue, with grey confidence intervals. The marginal effects are shown in <span style="color: crimson;">red</span> and <span style="color: orange;">orange</span> lines. Hover over and spin the graphic to examine the effects described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> (county median income) is shown with the <span style="color: crimson;">red</span> line.

<li>In this visualization, the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is shown holding <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> at its mean, and vice versa. Because the marginal effect is the same for any value <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> is set at, this is an arbitrary decision with no meaningful impact on the interpretation of the marginal effects.</li>

<li>The coefficient for county income, -0.013, is negative. However, it is not statistically significant at the p-value noted in the regression results, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.05\)</span>. Therefore we are not confident that this effect is negative. The coefficient could be positive or effectively zero</li>

<ul>
<li>There is a negative relationship between county level education and shifting to Trump. Because it has stars, we think with 90% confidence* that this negative sign is not due to chance alone.</li>
<li>Therefore, we believe that when county level education increases <em>and county level median income remains constant</em>, there is a decreased shift in the county’s Trump vote.</li>
<li>This value of the coefficient, -0.344, is called the <em>estimated effect</em> size of county median income on shifting to Trump between 2012 and 2016.</li>
<li>We cannot be confident in the exact value of this coefficient. We can only be confident that the direction is negative.</li>
<li>In technical terms, we have rejected the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero, and accept the alternate hypothesis that the coefficient is negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Recall that when <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.05\)</span>, we are 95% confident that the coefficient is non-zero, and 90% confident in the sign (positive/negative) of the coefficient.</p>
